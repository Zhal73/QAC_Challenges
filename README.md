julydevops.py

Write a python script with the above name which does the following:

- initialises a list which contains the FIRST NAME of all 21 people in this cohort
- using the .append() function add me to the list
- print the 5th person in the list (this is a trick question, what is special about the way Python indexes?)
- print the number of Chris in the cohort

Once you have a solution, remember to push it to github.
