Write a python script with the above name which does the following:<br />
initialises a list which contains the FIRST NAME of all 21 people in this cohort<br />
using the .append() function add me to the list<br />
print the 5th person in the list (this is a trick question, what is special about the way Python indexes?)<br />
print the number of Chris in the cohort <br />

Once you have a solution, remember to push it to github. <br />
