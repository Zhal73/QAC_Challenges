julydevops.py

Write a python script with the above name which does the following:

- initialises a list which contains the FIRST NAME of all 21 people in this cohort
- using the .append() function add me to the list
- print the 5th person in the list (this is a trick question, what is special about the way Python indexes?)
- print the number of Chris in the cohort

Once you have a solution, remember to push it to github.

timestable.py

Make a python script with the above name which solves the following challenge: 

https://portal.qa-community.co.uk/~/devops/challenges/times-table-grid

Given an integer n, write a python function which returns a times table grid for all the integers between 1 and n.
The grid should be separated by tabs and new lines.

For example, given n = 4 it should return the grid

1   2   3   4
2   4   6   8
3   6   9   12
4   8   12  16

given n=7 it should return

1   2   3   4   5   6   7   
2   4   6   8   10  12  14  
3   6   9   12  15  18  21  
4   8   12  16  20  24  28  
5   10  15  20  25  30  35  
6   12  18  24  30  36  42  
7   14  21  28  35  42  49

I have a function called `string_gen()` that will return a random 5-character-long string of lowercase letters. Write some tests for this function. 

To reiterate, the output should always be:
	
- a string
- 5 characters long
- comprised of lowercase letters
